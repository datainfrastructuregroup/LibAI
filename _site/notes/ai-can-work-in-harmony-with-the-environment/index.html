        <p>AI development can work in alignment with environmental sustainability and ecological preservation.</p>
<p>Liberatory AI is not just about avoiding harm; it is about actively creating systems that regenerate the planet and foster thriving communities. It is a vision of AI that is rooted in care, respect, and reciprocity—a vision that sees technology not as a tool for domination but as a means of deepening our connection to the Earth and each other. By embracing this philosophy, we can create AI systems that are not only sustainable but also life-affirming, ensuring a future where both humans and the planet can flourish.</p>
<p>At its core, liberatory AI rejects the extractive logics that dominate corporate AI systems, which treat the Earth as a resource to be exploited and communities as collateral damage. Instead, it seeks to create AI systems that honor the interconnectedness of all life, and prioritize the flourishing of both human and non-human beings.</p>
<p>Liberatory AI begins with the understanding that the Earth is not an externality or a resource to be mined and discarded. It is <strong>a living, breathing ecosystem to which we are deeply connected</strong>. This means designing AI systems that work in harmony with the planet, rather than against it. For example, liberatory AI would prioritize renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal to power data centers, even if this presents technical challenges. The fluctuating nature of renewable energy might require innovative solutions, such as energy storage systems or decentralized computing, but these challenges are seen as opportunities to align AI development with the rhythms of the Earth, rather than forcing the planet to conform to the demands of technology. [1](javascript:void(0))We’re mindful that the development of renewable energy can cause other ecological problems. A liberatory approach to AI considers these tensions.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17928-5">Read More</a></p>
<p>Liberatory AI also honors the planetary limits of our home. It recognizes that elements  like water, metals, and energy are finite and must be used thoughtfully. This means designing hardware that is durable, repairable, and recyclable, and creating systems that minimize waste. For example, the materials used to build data centers might be repurposed from existing structures, and the metals and components could be part of a circular economy. When a data center is no longer needed, its materials can be reused in other projects, ensuring that nothing is wasted and that the Earth is not burdened with more extraction.</p>
<p>We advocate for an AI that challenges the foundational core of corporate AI by rejecting the extractive logics that treat the Earth as a resource and exploit relationships. Instead, it embraces a relational way of being rooted in decolonial and Indigenous ways of relating to land. As scholar Kyle Whyte has pointed out, we are not only past the climate crisis tipping point but also past the <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.603">relational tipping point</a>. This means that the crisis we face is not just about the physical consumption of resources but about the breakdown of our relationships with the Earth and each other. Liberatory AI seeks to (re)configure these relationships, recognizing the Earth as a living, sacred relative rather than a resource to be exploited.</p>
