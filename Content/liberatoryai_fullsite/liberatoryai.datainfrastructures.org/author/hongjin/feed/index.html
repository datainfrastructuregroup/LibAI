<span id="more-238"></span>



<p>Liberatory AI is not just about avoiding harm; it is about actively creating systems that regenerate the planet and foster thriving communities. It is a vision of AI that is rooted in care, respect, and reciprocity—a vision that sees technology not as a tool for domination but as a means of deepening our connection to the Earth and each other. By embracing this philosophy, we can create AI systems that are not only sustainable but also life-affirming, ensuring a future where both humans and the planet can flourish.</p>



<p>At its core, liberatory AI rejects the extractive logics that dominate corporate AI systems, which treat the Earth as a resource to be exploited and communities as collateral damage. Instead, it seeks to create AI systems that honor the interconnectedness of all life, and prioritize the flourishing of both human and non-human beings.</p>



<p>Liberatory AI begins with the understanding that the Earth is not an externality or a resource to be mined and discarded. It is <strong>a living, breathing ecosystem to which we are deeply connected</strong>. This means designing AI systems that work in harmony with the planet, rather than against it. For example, liberatory AI would prioritize renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal to power data centers, even if this presents technical challenges. The fluctuating nature of renewable energy might require innovative solutions, such as energy storage systems or decentralized computing, but these challenges are seen as opportunities to align AI development with the rhythms of the Earth, rather than forcing the planet to conform to the demands of technology. <sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote ">1</sup></p>



<p>Liberatory AI also honors the planetary limits of our home. It recognizes that elements&nbsp; like water, metals, and energy are finite and must be used thoughtfully. This means designing hardware that is durable, repairable, and recyclable, and creating systems that minimize waste. For example, the materials used to build data centers might be repurposed from existing structures, and the metals and components could be part of a circular economy. When a data center is no longer needed, its materials can be reused in other projects, ensuring that nothing is wasted and that the Earth is not burdened with more extraction.</p>



<p>We advocate for an AI that challenges the foundational core of corporate AI by rejecting the extractive logics that treat the Earth as a resource and exploit relationships. Instead, it embraces a relational way of being rooted in decolonial and Indigenous ways of relating to land. As scholar Kyle Whyte has pointed out, we are not only past the climate crisis tipping point but also past the<a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.603"> relational tipping point</a>. This means that the crisis we face is not just about the physical consumption of resources but about the breakdown of our relationships with the Earth and each other. Liberatory AI seeks to (re)configure these relationships, recognizing the Earth as a living, sacred relative rather than a resource to be exploited.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Corporate AI relies on extraction of the planet, people, and data contributing to the global climate crisis and environmental injustice.</p>



<span id="more-234"></span>



<p>Corporate AI systems are often celebrated as revolutionary tools that promise to transform industries, enhance productivity, and solve complex social problems. However, the development, maintenance, and use of these systems are built upon a deeply extractive relationship with the Earth. The planet is treated as an externality—a resource to be exploited rather than a living entity to be respected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, the production of AI is frequently portrayed as a purely digital or intellectual endeavor in the “clouds.” This <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300264630/atlas-of-ai/">abstraction hides</a> the physical infrastructure and labor required to create and sustain AI systems. AI is not a distant, ethereal intelligence but a material network of people, servers, and computers located in real places on Earth, often in the form of massive data centers. These data centers are dependent on materials and energy extracted from the Earth, including rare earth metals, fossil fuels, and water. The extraction of these resources often occurs in marginalized communities, where environmental degradation and labor exploitation are rampant. For example, the mining of cobalt and lithium for hardware components has been linked to human rights abuses and ecological destruction in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo. The rapid expansion of data centers also pushes communities off the land they have lived and worked on for generations. The physical space AI occupies is not neutral; it is a site of conflict where corporate interests often override the rights and livelihoods of local communities.</p>



<p>Secondly, AI systems are inherently <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P19-1355/">resource-intensive</a>, requiring significant amounts of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/how-ai-cloud-computing-may-delay-transition-clean-energy-2024-11-21/">energy</a>, water, and raw materials to function. Data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity, often generated from extractive industries like coal and natural gas. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Training large AI models</a>, such as OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 or Google&#8217;s Bard, requires computational power equivalent to the energy consumption of thousands of households for extended periods. Data centers also require vast amounts of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271">water for cooling</a>, straining local water supplies and exacerbating water scarcity in already <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2024/05/06/data-centers-are-draining-resources-in-water-stressed-communities/">vulnerable regions</a>. When servers become obsolete due to the relentless drive for more processing powers they are discarded, contributing to the growing problem of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/28/1106316/ai-e-waste/">electronic waste</a>. The significant <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/building-materials-and-climate-constructing-new-future">“embodied” carbon emissions</a> of constructing and building data centers are also part of the life cycle of AI systems.</p>



<p>Finally, the dominant paradigm in corporate AI development is growth without limits, driven by the belief that bigger models and more data will unlock unprecedented economic value. This mindset treats the Earth as an infinite resource, ignoring the ecological and social costs of extraction and consumption that require more data, energy, and computational power. The extractive and resource-intensive nature of AI exacerbates the very problems it is often touted as solving, such as optimizing energy use or reducing waste.&nbsp; Additionally, marginalized communities, far removed from the corporate centers where AI products are used, disproportionately bear the costs of raw material extraction, data center construction, and energy generation. These communities face the immediate impacts of environmental degradation, displacement, and health hazards while reaping few of the benefits of AI advancements&#8230; The actual siting of these communities can lead to protests, zoning conflicts, and political challenges. For example, in Arizona, fossil fuel projects are being expanded to help provide for more data centers while Black communities face continued health disparities caused by the projects, and Navajo Nation citizens continue to lack electricity on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/23/arizona-data-centers-navajo-power-aps-srp/">portions of the reservation.</a> In Querétaro, the state government continues to provide incentives to these data <a href="https://www.context.news/ai/thirsty-data-centres-spring-up-in-water-poor-mexican-town">centers</a> in the midst of a drought.</p>



<p>The environmental impact and justice issues of corporate AI are starting to get the attention they deserve, though not nearly enough. Journalists, academics, and activists have been pointing out how AI systems are contributing to climate change, resource depletion, and environmental injustice. These critiques are vital, but they often focus on the <em>symptoms</em> of the problem rather than the <em>root causes</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about issues is the massive energy and water consumption of AI systems. Another major critique focuses on the environmental justice issues tied to AI. In response to these critiques, some tools have been developed to help mitigate AI’s environmental impact. For example, carbon calculators allow AI developers to estimate the carbon footprint of their models. These tools are a step in the right direction, but they often place the burden of responsibility on individual AI developers and users rather than addressing the systemic issues at play. While it’s important for individuals to be aware of their environmental impact, focusing on individual actions can distract from the larger problem: the role of corporations in driving the demand for resource-intensive AI systems. <strong>What’s needed is a shift in focus from individual responsibility to </strong><strong><em>corporate accountability</em></strong>. Corporations must be held responsible for transitioning to green energy grids to power their data centers, designing hardware with longer lifespans, and ensuring that their supply chains are free from exploitation and environmental harm. This requires systemic change, not just individual action.</p>



<p>The existing dominant critiques shine a light on important issues, but they don’t go far enough in challenging the systems that create those issues in the first place. For example, while it’s great to talk about reducing AI’s carbon footprint, we also need to ask why is AI needed and so resource-intensive in the first place. Is it because of technical necessity, or is it because corporations are chasing endless growth and profit? <strong>What’s often missing from these dominant critiques is a deeper discussion about </strong><strong><em>values</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Corporate AI is built on a worldview that sees the Earth and its inhabitants as resources to be exploited. A liberatory&nbsp; AI way, on the other hand, starts from a place of respect—for people, for communities, and for the planet. It draws from Indigenous knowledge and centers the communities that sustainably steward the land. It asks: What if AI wasn’t designed to extract resources from the Earth and exploit marginalized communities? What if it was built to respect ecological limits and prioritize justice? What if it was built upon systems of values that celebrate sustainability and harmony with the earth instead of an infinite growth mindset? These questions go beyond making AI “less bad”—they demand a fundamental rethinking of what AI is for and who it serves.</p>
