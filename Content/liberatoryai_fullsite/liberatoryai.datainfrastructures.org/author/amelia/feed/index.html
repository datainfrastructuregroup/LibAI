										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Center for Land Use Interpretation over a decade ago took pictures of the internet. It was not photos of people on computer screens at the libraries or cafes. Most of the photos were actually of anonymous looking office buildings and squat structures <a href="https://clui.org/newsletter/winter-2014/networked-nation-0">behind manicured trees and plants</a>. These photos were mostly of data centers, the specific places and spaces that the internet occupies. The internet and AI are cables buried underground, smaller cables hanging perilously through tree branches entering a house, and data centers in office parks around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, corporate AI tries to convince us about the cloud being far away. As <a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/the-cloud-is-material/release/2)">Gonzalez Monserrate writes</a>, “[l]ike a puffy cumulus drifting across a clear blue sky, refusing to maintain a solid shape or form, the Cloud of the digital is elusive, its inner workings largely mysterious to the wider public.”&nbsp; Corporate AI is advantaged of divorcing us from the places and spaces it exists in. Google, on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/advantages-of-cloud-computing">their page selling cloud computing</a>, tries to convince corporations “cloud computing enables companies to access and manage resources and applications anywhere there’s an internet connection.” The corporate cloud and AI enables users to no longer be somewhere. It promises an untethered future. By relying on abstracting space and place, a form of universalizing,&nbsp; corporate AI is able to assert that its findings are universal, not influenced or bound by specific locations it has origins in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvVllP-Jrzk">a recent demo</a> of one of Google Cloud’s products with Deutsche Telekom using a Gemini Multimodal Live API, a demonstrator seemingly takes a photo of a larger than human vibrant floral installation. The wall towers over the demonstrator with large green leaves, bright pink flowers, and interspersed with red and yellow flowers. Once the app session starts, the camera identifies flowers being shown and the demonstrator prompts the device for more detail about a tiered yellow flower. The device identifies the flower as a Guzmania. The demonstrator then asks where the plant is from, and the device recites facts about the Guzmania originating from South and Central America. The short minute and a half demo then wraps up. Through the short demo we are transported to a technology partnership with a German telecommunications firm where a host of exotic plants have been imported and carefully arranged to a conference venue, where we are not exactly sure, to have information about the plan’s origins shared. The only place named&nbsp; in the short clip is South and Central America. We are able to understand how the space and place where the AI is being demonstrated is not of importance, much less which data center the AI was trained in. The AI is universal not coming from a specific space or place, but the flowers in their bright tangibility must be from somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The actual infrastructure of AI must be located in a specific place, not only a geographical space but also within a place that is embedded in a local context like in the photo series from Center for Land Use Interpretation. This concern of Corporate AI is discussed more within the principle of harmony with Earth. Being able to abstract out the questions of space and place, allows corporate AI to shun questions often investigated by critical geography, environmental history, and others using spatial methods. Being able to dodge questions of space and place, also allows corporate AI to cast off questions about how corporate AI allows wealth accumulation among a few tech hotspots in the Global North. Rather, the flowers must be the object of attention, not the AI itself.</p>



<p>Reading space and place into corporate AI asks not just questions of infrastructure but also questions of where the AI is being developed. Much of AI is produced from developers in the Global North which erases other forms of knowledge produced around the world. This results in predictions and datasets mostly based on knowledge from specific places that attempt to sell their cultural assumptions as universal. This concentration of AI also results in AI flattening our understandings of space and place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent study of ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 asked the generative AI model to produce images from 64 cities around the world (Jang et al., 2024)<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03645-7">7</a>). The authors found that when asked to produce images of Boston’s white neighborhoods the images returned well-kept brown stones, whereas when asked for images of the black community, images showed ill-maintained streetscapes with plain architecture. The generative AI was reinforcing racist notions of places when producing images of racialized communities. Another finding from the study was that while some of the generative AI model images were place-specific such as highlighting New York’s pre-war architecture or Singapore’s rainforest vegetation. Many of the images also flattened notions of place without including notable landmarks people may associate with cities (ie: the Sydney Opera House) and a “generic landscape of an urban environment is rendered.” These findings highlight how in many generative AI models the specificity of place can be erased through normative images constantly reproduced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous work has shown disparities in how well object recognition AI differs across places where images were taken (De Veries et al., 2019)cite:). The authors provide the example of an image of soap taken in Nepal, the picture has two bars of soap and well-used sponge. Most object recognition systems identified it as food of some sort, while object recognition systems&nbsp; easily identified a bottle of soap on a sink from the UK as part of a sink or soap dispenser of some sort. Many image datasets are concentrated with images from the Global North disproportionately. While researchers have offered datasets with common objects from more places like Africa (cite: https://victordibia.com/cocoafrica/static/assets/paper/draft.pdf). Simple fixes on representation bias continue to not address the historical biases that corporate AI continues to perpetuate against specific places. Increasing representation from specific places does not make the tools AI universal but continues to reinforce the idea that AI meant to be abstracted from space, instead of grounded in specific geographies with specific contexts (link to the context principle).&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A liberatory AI ecosystem is grounded in space and place, this includes the infrastructure that is used to create and maintain it (ie: data centers) and the spaces and places it attempts to present. These places and the knowledges they produce are considered integral to the creations of this AI. Liberatory AI centers a place-based, ecosystemic approach to computing. This means attending to the flourishing of human and other kin present in the places and lands the AI touches. Rida Qadri, attempts to do this by placing communities as experts in the representation. With participants from South Asia, Qadri and co-authors identified that many text to image generators failed to recognize cultural subjects and perpetuated Western imagery over South Asian contexts. The images also reinforced harmful cultural stereotypes when creating images of cities like Peshawar and Mumbai. Instead of the iconic cultural heritage of the cities, dusty and dirty images were generated. A liberatory AI would emphasize the place-based knowledge coming from Qadri’s participants who took pride in the places they were from.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By attending to the specificity of space and place, we are able to better care for different corners of the world. Paying attention to geographies allow us to imagine more possibilities and worlds rather than focus on making many tools doing the same, universal end goal. Recent work has highlighted how land-based and place-based education can put us more in conversation with Indigenous cosmologies and relationships We might learn from Āhau a Maori-led data platform that allows whānau (families) and tribal communities to share and record information in <a href="https://ahau.io/faqs.html">whānau-managed databases</a> that can communicate with a Pātaka server. The database management prioritizes privacy by storing data locally on the users’ device and for passing on history to descendents. Users can also configure cultural protocols to determine who in the community can access certain data. While these projects highlight the importance of sovereignty for tribal communities, they also demonstrate how developing technology from a place and space centered development attitude can create more relevant and values-aligned technologies for communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a liberatory AI ecosystem, the places the AI was developed, the data is stored, and the infrastructure is present could be documented. This might in addition to already existing methods for accounting for models like model cards. This might also mean articulating how the developers of the AI tool are accountable to their local community. Being involved with people in their vicinity is necessary for developers to make sense of hyperlocal data and knowledge as researchers examining AI usage in citizen science contexts have pointed out. We must imagine a liberatory AI that allows us to account for the infrastructure of AI and the places it is used.</p>

<span id="more-238"></span>



<p>Liberatory AI is not just about avoiding harm; it is about actively creating systems that regenerate the planet and foster thriving communities. It is a vision of AI that is rooted in care, respect, and reciprocity—a vision that sees technology not as a tool for domination but as a means of deepening our connection to the Earth and each other. By embracing this philosophy, we can create AI systems that are not only sustainable but also life-affirming, ensuring a future where both humans and the planet can flourish.</p>



<p>At its core, liberatory AI rejects the extractive logics that dominate corporate AI systems, which treat the Earth as a resource to be exploited and communities as collateral damage. Instead, it seeks to create AI systems that honor the interconnectedness of all life, and prioritize the flourishing of both human and non-human beings.</p>



<p>Liberatory AI begins with the understanding that the Earth is not an externality or a resource to be mined and discarded. It is <strong>a living, breathing ecosystem to which we are deeply connected</strong>. This means designing AI systems that work in harmony with the planet, rather than against it. For example, liberatory AI would prioritize renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal to power data centers, even if this presents technical challenges. The fluctuating nature of renewable energy might require innovative solutions, such as energy storage systems or decentralized computing, but these challenges are seen as opportunities to align AI development with the rhythms of the Earth, rather than forcing the planet to conform to the demands of technology. <sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote ">1</sup></p>



<p>Liberatory AI also honors the planetary limits of our home. It recognizes that elements&nbsp; like water, metals, and energy are finite and must be used thoughtfully. This means designing hardware that is durable, repairable, and recyclable, and creating systems that minimize waste. For example, the materials used to build data centers might be repurposed from existing structures, and the metals and components could be part of a circular economy. When a data center is no longer needed, its materials can be reused in other projects, ensuring that nothing is wasted and that the Earth is not burdened with more extraction.</p>



<p>We advocate for an AI that challenges the foundational core of corporate AI by rejecting the extractive logics that treat the Earth as a resource and exploit relationships. Instead, it embraces a relational way of being rooted in decolonial and Indigenous ways of relating to land. As scholar Kyle Whyte has pointed out, we are not only past the climate crisis tipping point but also past the<a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.603"> relational tipping point</a>. This means that the crisis we face is not just about the physical consumption of resources but about the breakdown of our relationships with the Earth and each other. Liberatory AI seeks to (re)configure these relationships, recognizing the Earth as a living, sacred relative rather than a resource to be exploited.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Corporate AI relies on extraction of the planet, people, and data contributing to the global climate crisis and environmental injustice.</p>



<span id="more-234"></span>



<p>Corporate AI systems are often celebrated as revolutionary tools that promise to transform industries, enhance productivity, and solve complex social problems. However, the development, maintenance, and use of these systems are built upon a deeply extractive relationship with the Earth. The planet is treated as an externality—a resource to be exploited rather than a living entity to be respected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, the production of AI is frequently portrayed as a purely digital or intellectual endeavor in the “clouds.” This <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300264630/atlas-of-ai/">abstraction hides</a> the physical infrastructure and labor required to create and sustain AI systems. AI is not a distant, ethereal intelligence but a material network of people, servers, and computers located in real places on Earth, often in the form of massive data centers. These data centers are dependent on materials and energy extracted from the Earth, including rare earth metals, fossil fuels, and water. The extraction of these resources often occurs in marginalized communities, where environmental degradation and labor exploitation are rampant. For example, the mining of cobalt and lithium for hardware components has been linked to human rights abuses and ecological destruction in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo. The rapid expansion of data centers also pushes communities off the land they have lived and worked on for generations. The physical space AI occupies is not neutral; it is a site of conflict where corporate interests often override the rights and livelihoods of local communities.</p>



<p>Secondly, AI systems are inherently <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P19-1355/">resource-intensive</a>, requiring significant amounts of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/how-ai-cloud-computing-may-delay-transition-clean-energy-2024-11-21/">energy</a>, water, and raw materials to function. Data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity, often generated from extractive industries like coal and natural gas. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Training large AI models</a>, such as OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 or Google&#8217;s Bard, requires computational power equivalent to the energy consumption of thousands of households for extended periods. Data centers also require vast amounts of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271">water for cooling</a>, straining local water supplies and exacerbating water scarcity in already <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2024/05/06/data-centers-are-draining-resources-in-water-stressed-communities/">vulnerable regions</a>. When servers become obsolete due to the relentless drive for more processing powers they are discarded, contributing to the growing problem of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/28/1106316/ai-e-waste/">electronic waste</a>. The significant <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/building-materials-and-climate-constructing-new-future">“embodied” carbon emissions</a> of constructing and building data centers are also part of the life cycle of AI systems.</p>



<p>Finally, the dominant paradigm in corporate AI development is growth without limits, driven by the belief that bigger models and more data will unlock unprecedented economic value. This mindset treats the Earth as an infinite resource, ignoring the ecological and social costs of extraction and consumption that require more data, energy, and computational power. The extractive and resource-intensive nature of AI exacerbates the very problems it is often touted as solving, such as optimizing energy use or reducing waste.&nbsp; Additionally, marginalized communities, far removed from the corporate centers where AI products are used, disproportionately bear the costs of raw material extraction, data center construction, and energy generation. These communities face the immediate impacts of environmental degradation, displacement, and health hazards while reaping few of the benefits of AI advancements&#8230; The actual siting of these communities can lead to protests, zoning conflicts, and political challenges. For example, in Arizona, fossil fuel projects are being expanded to help provide for more data centers while Black communities face continued health disparities caused by the projects, and Navajo Nation citizens continue to lack electricity on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/23/arizona-data-centers-navajo-power-aps-srp/">portions of the reservation.</a> In Querétaro, the state government continues to provide incentives to these data <a href="https://www.context.news/ai/thirsty-data-centres-spring-up-in-water-poor-mexican-town">centers</a> in the midst of a drought.</p>



<p>The environmental impact and justice issues of corporate AI are starting to get the attention they deserve, though not nearly enough. Journalists, academics, and activists have been pointing out how AI systems are contributing to climate change, resource depletion, and environmental injustice. These critiques are vital, but they often focus on the <em>symptoms</em> of the problem rather than the <em>root causes</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about issues is the massive energy and water consumption of AI systems. Another major critique focuses on the environmental justice issues tied to AI. In response to these critiques, some tools have been developed to help mitigate AI’s environmental impact. For example, carbon calculators allow AI developers to estimate the carbon footprint of their models. These tools are a step in the right direction, but they often place the burden of responsibility on individual AI developers and users rather than addressing the systemic issues at play. While it’s important for individuals to be aware of their environmental impact, focusing on individual actions can distract from the larger problem: the role of corporations in driving the demand for resource-intensive AI systems. <strong>What’s needed is a shift in focus from individual responsibility to </strong><strong><em>corporate accountability</em></strong>. Corporations must be held responsible for transitioning to green energy grids to power their data centers, designing hardware with longer lifespans, and ensuring that their supply chains are free from exploitation and environmental harm. This requires systemic change, not just individual action.</p>



<p>The existing dominant critiques shine a light on important issues, but they don’t go far enough in challenging the systems that create those issues in the first place. For example, while it’s great to talk about reducing AI’s carbon footprint, we also need to ask why is AI needed and so resource-intensive in the first place. Is it because of technical necessity, or is it because corporations are chasing endless growth and profit? <strong>What’s often missing from these dominant critiques is a deeper discussion about </strong><strong><em>values</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Corporate AI is built on a worldview that sees the Earth and its inhabitants as resources to be exploited. A liberatory&nbsp; AI way, on the other hand, starts from a place of respect—for people, for communities, and for the planet. It draws from Indigenous knowledge and centers the communities that sustainably steward the land. It asks: What if AI wasn’t designed to extract resources from the Earth and exploit marginalized communities? What if it was built to respect ecological limits and prioritize justice? What if it was built upon systems of values that celebrate sustainability and harmony with the earth instead of an infinite growth mindset? These questions go beyond making AI “less bad”—they demand a fundamental rethinking of what AI is for and who it serves.</p>
