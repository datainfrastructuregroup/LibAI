As an academic, Stevens studies the ways that data infrastructures&#8211;data models, databases, data structures&#8211;can reinforce existing social inequality, and, crucially, how we can use data infrastructures to guide us towards the worlds we wish to build.  As a software engineer, they led the architecture of web properties for billion-dollar corporations like Coca-Cola, Sony, and Instagram, and their work won numerous awards, including at SXSW.  As a community organizer, Stevens&#8217;s work in the Drupal community earned them the Aaron Winborn Award and recognitions by Red Hat and The Linux Foundation.  They are currently a postdoctoral researcher at MIT where they are writing _Abolitionist Engineering_, a book about data infrastructure, software engineering, and the contemporary prison abolition movement.
