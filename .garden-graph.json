Competing for funding, market dominance, and regulatory approval, companies prioritize getting high performance numbers, sometimes even gaming the system by tweaking evaluation criteria to maximize reported accuracy. This results in a culture where AI success is measured by marketability rather than functionality. For instance, autonomous vehicle companies use “miles driven without disengagements”—the distance their cars can travel without human intervention—as a measure of success. Reporting disengagement rates is required by regulators like the California Department of Motor Vehicles, and high numbers are often used to impress investors and the public. Yet, companies can inflate this metric by testing in simpler environments, such as quiet suburbs or good weather conditions, rather than actually improving vehicle safety and capabilities.",

This means attending to the flourishing of human and other kin present in the places and lands the AI touches. Rida Qadri, attempts to do this by placing communities as experts in the representation. With participants from South Asia, Qadri and co-authors identified that many text to image generators failed to recognize cultural subjects and perpetuated Western imagery over South Asian contexts. The images also reinforced harmful cultural stereotypes when creating images of cities like Peshawar and Mumbai. Instead of the iconic cultural heritage of the cities, dusty and dirty images were generated.
