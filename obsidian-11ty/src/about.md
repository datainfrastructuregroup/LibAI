# About Obsidian 11ty

This is a digital garden built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), inspired by [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). 

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is an approach to note-taking and knowledge management that emphasizes:
- **Non-linear thinking**: Connect ideas through [[wikilinks]]
- **Evergreen content**: Notes grow and evolve over time
- **Networked knowledge**: See how ideas relate to each other through [[backlinks]]

## Features

- **Wikilinks**: Use `[[note-name]]` to create connections between notes
- **Backlinks**: Automatically see which notes link to the current note
- **Monochromatic Design**: Clean, distraction-free interface with fixed-width font
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

1. Browse the [[All Notes]] page to see available content
2. Click on any note to read it
3. Look at the backlinks section to see related notes
4. Use the [[graph-view]] to visualize connections (placeholder)

## Technology

- **11ty**: Static site generator
- **Markdown**: Content authoring
- **Nunjucks**: Template engine
- **CSS**: Custom styling with monochromatic theme

*This site is a demonstration of networked note-taking. Feel free to explore and learn how ideas connect.*
