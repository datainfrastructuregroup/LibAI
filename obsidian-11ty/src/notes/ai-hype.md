# AI Hype and Techno-Futurism

The discourse surrounding artificial intelligence often exhibits characteristics of millenarianism and techno-futurism, promising revolutionary transformation while obscuring material realities and power dynamics.

## Millenarian Narratives

### AI as Salvation
The rhetoric around AI often mirrors religious millenarianism, promising:
- **Utopian Futures**: AI will solve all human problems
- **Transcendence**: Overcoming human limitations and mortality
- **Manifest Destiny**: Technological progress as inevitable and good
- **Singularity**: The emergence of superintelligence as evolutionary step

### Emily Gorcenski's Analysis
As Emily Gorcenski explores in "Making God" [@2023Making], the millenarianism and manifest destiny of AI and techno-futurism creates dangerous narratives that:

- **Obscure Material Realities**: Focus on abstract futures rather than present impacts
- **Justify Harm**: Accepting negative consequences for promised benefits
- **Concentrate Power**: Supporting centralized control over technological development
- **Silence Criticism**: Dismissing concerns as resistance to progress

## Techno-Futurist Ideology

### Core Beliefs
- **Technological Determinism**: Technology autonomously shapes society
- **Progress as Linear**: Continuous improvement through innovation
- **Market Solutions**: Technology can solve social and political problems
- **Expert Governance**: Technical experts should lead decision-making

### Manifest Destiny
The AI industry often frames its mission as:
- **Historical Inevitability**: AI development is unstoppable and necessary
- **Civilizational Mission**: Leading humanity into new era
- **Competitive Urgency**: Race against other nations or companies
- **Moral Imperative**: Developing AI is ethical obligation

## Critical Perspectives

### Alternative Frameworks
- **Critical Technology Studies**: Examining social contexts and impacts [@2024Start]
- **Postcolonial Analysis**: Understanding AI in context of colonial histories
- **Feminist Critique**: Examining gender and power in AI systems
- **Environmental Analysis**: Assessing ecological impacts of AI

### Resistance to Hype
- **Grounded Assessment**: Focusing on actual capabilities and limitations
- **Ethical Prioritization**: Centering values and justice over capabilities
- **Democratic Control**: Ensuring public oversight and participation
- **Alternative Futures**: Imagining different technological trajectories
