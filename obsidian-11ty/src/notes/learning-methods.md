# Learning Methods

Effective learning is about understanding how we acquire and retain knowledge. Here are evidence-based approaches:

## Active Recall

Instead of re-reading material, actively retrieve information from memory:
- [[Spaced-repetition]] systems
- [[Flashcards]] and self-testing
- Teaching others ([[Feynman-technique]])

## Spaced Repetition

Review information at increasing intervals:
- [[Anki]] for digital flashcards
- Physical card systems
- Calendar-based review

## The Feynman Technique

1. Choose a concept you want to understand
2. Teach it to someone else (or pretend to)
3. Identify gaps in your explanation
4. Review and simplify

## Interleaving

Mix different topics or problem types in study sessions rather than blocking them together.

## Elaboration

Connect new information to what you already know:
- Create [[Concept-maps]]
- Use [[Analogies]] and metaphors
- Ask "why" questions

## Related Topics

- [[Memory-techniques]]
- [[Study-habits]]
- [[Knowledge-management]]

The key is moving from passive consumption to active engagement with the material.
