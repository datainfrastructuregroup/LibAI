  abstract = {The slogan that the Trump campaign used in the 2024 US presidential election to tie rival Kamala Harris to trans activists in its television ads—“Kamala is for They/Them, Trump is for You”—makes no sense. It's grammatically incoherent, it melds non-binary people and trans women into one generic out-group, and it argues that Kamala Harris was somehow a champion for trans people when in fact many of Harris's strongest critics on the left were (and are) trans. But these ads weren't designed to make sense. Instead, they operate within a fascist mode of address that aims to elicit not meaning but sensation: to frighten, to confuse, and then to reorient those affective responses towards fealty to a protective leader. This article thinks through the operations of these media attacks, considers the distinction between transgender illiberalism and fascist illiberalism, and speculates on how trans cultural production might best answer the ascendant fascist aesthetics of nonsense and sensation.},

User-data, however, are surrounded by regulatory and legal ambiguities as they are not accounted for as intangible assets and their ownership and control are not transparent. I investigate how platforms rectify these ambiguities to realize user-data value as codified capital through an intensive case study of two major platforms. I use qualitative content analysis (QCA) to analyze annual and earnings reports, terms of service (ToS) agreements, and internal documents from 2017 through 2023 with qualitative data analysis (QDA) software. The findings reveal the exploitation of user-data ambiguities by platforms on two fronts: the necessary relationship between user-data inputs and platform outputs, with a growing emphasis on artificial intelligence, and the ownership and control of user-data. I argue that these ambiguities are exploited by platforms in a process of mystification of user-data to investors and other political economic actors at one end and users at the other. Mystified assets are then transformed into codified capital through financialization in the platform, contributing to studies of corporate financialization and fictitious capital. The findings place the ownership and control of user-data and their relationship to platform outputs as essential to advancing data accumulation and platform financialization.},

Often, these technologies, like Artificial Intelligence (AI), appear to determine what happens on a world stage, even as they are embedded in arrangements of power that elevate particular places, subjects, and ways of seeing. This paper investigates four dominant ways of narrating AI developments in the current moment: labour futures, information integrity, human creativity, and over-reliance on regulation. Through these frames, particular histories and futures are privileged while others are silenced. Drawing on Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s concept of the unthinkable in history and Milton Santos’ theories of the used territory alongside Shahidul Alam’s concept of the majority world, this paper suggests alternatives to these ways of seeing that emerge from thinking about AI from a majority world perspective. These alternative frames are: technolabour precarity, public contestations and political histories, relationality, and shared problematics. They point towards an understanding of AI that concomitantly reflects the empirical experience of the majority of the people in the world, and points towards AI futures that can match those experiences.},

Recent years have seen both an explosion in AI systems and a corresponding rise in important critical analyses of these technologies. Central to these analyses has been feminist scholarship, which calls upon the AI sector to be accountable for designing and deploying AI in ways that further, rather than undermine, the pursuit of social justice. Feminist AI showcases the vital contributions of feminist scholarship to thinking about AI, data, and intelligent machines as well as laying the groundwork for future feminist scholarship on AI. It brings together scholars from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, from computer science, software engineering, and medical sciences to political theory, anthropology, and literature. It provides an entry point for scholars of AI, science, and technology into the diversity of feminist approaches to AI, and creates a rich dialogue between scholars and practitioners of AI to examine the powerful congruences and generative tensions between different feminist approaches to new and emerging technologies.},

Within this space, we identify liberatory collections–community-led repositories that amplify Black voices–as a form of data collection that empowers and benefits communities historically harmed by traditional AI and archival practices. We survey fourteen liberatory collections, uncovering critical cultural perspectives and innovative approaches to obtaining, preserving, sharing, and valuing human information. Our findings emphasize the need for structural changes in AI training datasets and models, moving beyond representational adjustments toward strategies for creating consent-driven training models, funding community-based initiatives, and embedding Black communities’ multifaceted cultures and histories within AI systems. This research underscores liberatory collections’ potential as a framework for reimagining ethical AI development.},

  abstract = {The stated goal of many organizations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), an imagined system with more intelligence than anything we have ever seen. Without seriously questioning whether such a system can and should be built, researchers are working to create “safe AGI” that is “beneficial for all of humanity.” We argue that, unlike systems with specific applications which can be evaluated following standard engineering principles, undefined systems like “AGI” cannot be appropriately tested for safety. Why, then, is building AGI often framed as an unquestioned goal in the field of AI? In this paper, we argue that the normative framework that motivates much of this goal is rooted in the Anglo-American eugenics tradition of the twentieth century. As a result, many of the very same discriminatory attitudes that animated eugenicists in the past (e.g., racism, xenophobia, classism, ableism, and sexism) remain widespread within the movement to build AGI, resulting in systems that harm marginalized groups and centralize power, while using the language of “safety” and “benefiting humanity” to evade accountability. We conclude by urging researchers to work on defined tasks for which we can develop safety protocols, rather than attempting to build a presumably all-knowing system such as AGI.},

Founded as a nonprofit with safety enshrined as its core mission, the organization was meant, its leader Sam Altman told us, to act as a check against more purely mercantile, and potentially dangerous, forces. What could go wrong?Over time, Hao began to wrestle ever more deeply with that question. Increasingly, she realized that the core truth of this massively disruptive sector is that its vision of success requires an almost unprecedented amount of resources: the “compute” power of high-end chips and the processing capacity to create massive large language models, the sheer volume of data that needs to be amassed at scale, the humans “cleaning up” that data for sweatshop wages throughout the Global South, and a truly alarming spike in the usage of energy and water underlying it all. The truth is that we have entered a new and ominous age of empire: only a small handful of globally scaled companies can even enter the field of play. At the head of the pack with its ChatGPT breakthrough, how would OpenAI resist such temptations?Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Armed with Microsoft’s billions, OpenAI is setting a breakneck pace, chased by a small group of the most valuable companies in human history—toward what end, not even they can define. All this time, Hao has maintained her deep sourcing within the company and the industry, and so she was in intimate contact with the story that shocked the entire tech industry—Altman’s sudden firing and triumphant return. The behind-the-scenes story of what happened, told here in full for the first time, is revelatory of who the people controlling this technology really are. But this isn’t just the story of a single company, however fascinating it is. The g forces pressing down on the people of OpenAI are deforming the judgment of everyone else too—as such forces do. Naked power finds the ideology to cloak itself; no one thinks they’re the bad guy. But in the meantime, as Hao shows through intrepid reporting on the ground around the world, the enormous wheels of extraction grind on. By drawing on the viewpoints of Silicon Valley engineers, Kenyan data laborers, and Chilean water activists, Hao presents the fullest picture of AI and its impact we’ve seen to date, alongside a trenchant analysis of where things are headed. An astonishing eyewitness view from both up in the command capsule of the new economy and down where the real suffering happens, Empire of AI pierces the veil of the industry defining our era.},

  abstract = {This Handbook aims to provide a comprehensive, international cartography of Queer Death Studies, offering broad, in-depth insights into the field and its emergence through tentacular transdisciplinary networking. Taking research and art-making on death, dying, mourning, and afterlife into new directions, it explores the multiple effects of contemporary necropolitics and the proliferation of death-worlds during the current period of Earth’s history, ‘The Anthropocene’ or ‘the Age of Man’. Informed by queer, critical posthumanist, decolonial, and feminist approaches, the Handbook presents a unique variety of both critical and affirmative reflections upon the world’s intersecting necropowers, and ethico-political potentials for social and environmental change. Contributors speculate on ways to reimagine life/ death-relations as vibrant entanglements. They also investigate modes of mourning differently, resisting necropolitical regimes that deem human and non-human individuals and populations to be disposable and non-grievable when they differ too much from the normative modern subject, Universal Man, in terms of intersections of gender, racialisation, class, sexuality, embodiment, embrainment, geopolitical positioning, or species. A thought provoking read, this Handbook is intended for broad global audiences of researchers, artists, teachers, students, death-professionals, (health)careworkers, activists, and NGOs interested in tools to rethink and reimagine death, dying, mourning, and afterlife from intersections of queering, decolonising, posthumanising, and feminist perspectives.},

This introduction to the Special Issue on Analysing Articifial Intelligence Controversies (?) discusses how the contributing articles and commentaries address this question through original research and critical reflection. We argue that AI presents a watershed moment for the analysis of public controversies about science and technology insofar as AI controversies today often serve as occasions for the demonstration of techno-scientific authority and the reassertion of hierarchies between expert and lay, which challenges the framing of controversy as a force of democratisation in Science \& Technology Studies. We discuss how this technopolitical context compels us to investigate anew the relations between AI controversies and the situations—the underlying tensions, disputes and frictions in society—to which these controversies are relevant, or alleged to be relevant. We identify four different modalities in which AI controversies operate on social and political situations: (1) The controversy conceals the situation. (2) The controversy articulates the situation. (3) The situation articulates the controversy. (4) The controversy and the situation are mutually irrelevant. We draw on the contributions to the Special Theme to develop a typology of these four modalities and discuss how these contributions themselves address the wider challenge of controversy as a force of “authoritanization” by reworking the concepts and methods of Controversy Analysis and by critically investigating, evaluating and reflecting on AI controversies of the last 10 years.},

Yet oil presents a much larger problem for democracy: faced with the threats of oil depletion and catastrophic climate change, the democratic machineries that emerged to govern the age of carbon energy seem to be unable to address the processes that may end it. This article explores these multiple dimensions of carbon democracy, by examining the intersecting histories of coal, oil and democracy in the twentieth century. Following closely the methods by which fossil fuels were produced, distributed and converted into other forms of socio-technical organization, financial circulation and political power, the article traces ways in which the concentration and control of energy flows could open up democratic possibilities or close them down; how connections were engineered in the post-war period between the flow of oil and the flows of international finance, on which democratic stability was thought to depend; how these same circulations made possible the emergence of the economy and its unlimited growth as the main object of democratic politics; and how the relations among forms of energy, finance, economic knowledge, democracy and violence were transformed in the 1967–74 oil–dollar Middle East crises.},

  abstract = {This essay explores how enhancing accountability in the governance and use of data can increase its value as a relational asset within platform economies. With a focus on data intermediaries (entities that collect, curate and process data into products and services), it argues that data does not possess inherent value; rather, value emerges through socio-technical practices and relational exchanges. Drawing on theoretical frameworks from economic anthropology and Science and Technology Studies, this essay examines how intermediaries translate raw data into valuable outputs, often in ways that obscure the agency of data contributors. This opacity limits accountability and ambiguates the connection between those who generate data and those who profit from it. Through a case study of the Superset ecosystem–a decentralized governance infrastructure that combines market incentives, a data trust framework, and participatory enforcement mechanisms–this essay illustrates how designing for accountability has the potential to unlock greater value across the data economy. By integrating data contributors into governance processes, Superset demonstrates a ‘middle-out’ approach to value creation (rather than top-down or bottom-up), where accountability and value are mutually reinforcing. This reframes data not as a static commodity, but as a dynamic, relational form of capital, dependent on participation and platform-enforceable accountability.},

  abstract = {The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into decision-making processes has raised concerns about the reproduction of gender and ethnic biases within algorithmic systems. While a growing body of research has addressed this issue, the field remains fragmented due to the absence of a unified conceptual framework for bias, fairness, and inclusivity. This lack of definitional clarity hinders the development of effective mitigation strategies and exacerbates epistemological and operational inconsistencies. To address this gap, this study conducts a scoping review of the literature on algorithmic bias, adopting a socio-technical perspective to map existing research and identify critical gaps. By systematically analyzing a broad range of scholarly contributions, the review explores the conceptual and methodological approaches that shape current debates on algorithmic fairness. Using the PRISMA methodology, it synthesizes diverse strands of research to assess how bias is theorized, measured, and mitigated across disciplines. The findings reveal a persistent lack of consensus on how algorithmic bias and fairness should be defined, leading to challenges in both theoretical articulation and practical implementation. In response, this study advocates for a multilevel and multidimensional approach to bias mitigation, one that integrates computational, ethical, and social dimensions. This framework aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 5—gender equality and SDG 10—reduced inequalities), underscoring the necessity of interdisciplinary strategies that move beyond purely technical interventions. By foregrounding a socio-technical perspective, this review highlights the urgency of designing AI systems that not only mitigate bias but also actively contribute to the construction of more equitable and inclusive technological ecosystems.},

It was my first Saturday in Brazil, in the middle of a period of military dictatorship in that country, and I was taken to visit some theologians working with base ecclesial communities in São Paulo. I recall entering a large building which served as a community centre for one of the shanty towns on the periphery of this enormous city. Inside there were about forty men and women listening to a woman expound the first chapter of the book of Revelation. She was standing at a table at which were sitting two men. Her lecture was constantly interrupted by her audience sharing their experience of situations parallel with that of John on Patmos: witness, endurance, and tribulation. One man who had been active in trade unions spoke with me after the meeting describing the way in which the book of Revelation spoke to his situation: he had been imprisoned without trial, and a Church which had seemed so irrelevant and remote had become a shelter and inspiration for his life. There was an atmosphere of utter comprehension of, and accord with, John’s situation, as trade union activists, catechists and human rights workers shared their experiences of persecution and harassment as a result of their work with the poor and marginalised. They found in John a kindred spirit as they sought to understand and build up their communities in the face of the contemporary beast of poverty and oppression. It was readily apparent as I listened to their eager attempts to relate Revelation to their situation that they had discovered a text which spoke to them because they had not been desensitised by an ordered and respectable life of accommodation and assimilation. The woman and one of the men at the front of the meeting were teachers at the local seminary and the other man the local Roman Catholic bishop.},

Far from a “glitch” or unintentional error, these endemic issues are a function of the interlocking systems of oppression upon which AI is built. Using the analytical framework of “Empire,” this paper demonstrates that we live not simply in the “age of AI” but in the age of AI Empire. Specifically, we show that this networked and distributed global order is rooted in heteropatriarchy, racial capitalism, white supremacy, and coloniality and perpetuates its influence through the mechanisms of extractivism, automation, essentialism, surveillance, and containment. Therefore, we argue that any attempt at reforming AI from within the same interlocking oppressive systems that created it is doomed to failure and, moreover, risks exacerbating existing harm. Instead, to advance justice, we must radically transform not just the technology itself, but our ideas about it, and develop it from the bottom up, from the perspectives of those who stand the most risk of being harmed.},

  abstract = {With the growing attention and investment in recent AI approaches such as large language models, the narrative that the larger the AI system the more valuable, powerful and interesting it is is increasingly seen as common sense. But what is this assumption based on, and how are we measuring value, power, and performance? And what are the collateral consequences of this race to ever-increasing scale? Here, we scrutinize the current scaling trends and trade-offs across multiple axes and refute two common assumptions underlying the ‘bigger-is-better’ AI paradigm: 1) that performance improvements are driven by increased scale, and 2) that all interesting problems addressed by AI require large-scale models. Rather, we argue that this approach is not only fragile scientifically, but comes with undesirable consequences. First, it is not sustainable, as, despite efficiency improvements, its compute demands increase faster than model performance, leading to unreasonable economic requirements and a disproportionate environmental footprint. Second, it implies focusing on certain problems at the expense of others, leaving aside important applications, e.g. health, education, or the climate. Finally, it exacerbates a concentration of power, which centralizes decision-making in the hands of a few actors while threatening to disempower others in the context of shaping both AI research and its applications throughout society.},
