# AI Ethics and Governance

The ethical implications of artificial intelligence extend beyond individual applications to encompass systemic questions of power, governance, and social impact. Critical examination of AI systems requires attention to both technical and social dimensions.

## Critical AI Studies

The field of Technology Studies emphasizes starting "where the pain is" [@2024Start] - focusing on the actual impacts and harms of technological systems rather than abstract potential. This methodology requires:

### Ethical Frameworks
- **Justice and Equity**: Examining who benefits and who bears costs
- **Power Analysis**: Understanding how AI systems reinforce existing hierarchies
- **Community Impact**: Assessing effects on different communities
- **Long-term Consequences**: Considering systemic implications

## Governance Structures

Effective AI governance requires multiple approaches:

### Regulatory Approaches
- **Policy Development**: Creating appropriate regulatory frameworks
- **Industry Standards**: Establishing best practices and norms
- **International Cooperation**: Addressing global challenges collaboratively
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Ensuring accountability and compliance

### Participatory Governance
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Including affected communities in decision-making
- **Transparency Requirements**: Making systems and processes visible
- **Redress Mechanisms**: Providing ways to address harms
- **Democratic Oversight**: Ensuring public control over critical systems

## Technologies of Resistance

As Agnew et al. note [@agnewTechnologies], resistance to problematic AI systems involves developing alternative approaches:

### Alternative Systems
- **Community-owned Infrastructure**: Developing non-extractive technologies
- **Privacy-preserving Methods**: Creating systems that respect autonomy
- **Open Source Tools**: Fostering collaborative development
- **Decentralized Networks**: Reducing concentration of power

## Critical Questions

- Who benefits from AI systems and who bears the costs?
- How do AI systems reinforce or challenge existing power structures?
- What values are embedded in technical design choices?
- How can we ensure democratic control over critical technologies?
