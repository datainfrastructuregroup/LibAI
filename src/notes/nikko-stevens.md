description: Dr. Nikko Stevens is a critical technology researcher, software engineer,
      and community organizer. As an academic, Stevens studies the ways that
      data infrastructures–data models, databases, data structures–can reinforce
      existing social inequality, and, crucially, how we can use data
      infrastructures to guide us towards the worlds we wish to build. As a
      software engineer, they led the architecture of web properties for
      billion-dollar corporations like Coca-Cola, Sony, and Instagram, and their
      work won numerous awards, including at SXSW. As a community organizer,
      Stevens’s work in the Drupal community earned them the Aaron Winborn Award
      and recognitions by Red Hat and The Linux Foundation. They are currently a
      postdoctoral researcher at MIT where they are writing _Abolitionist
      Engineering_, a book about data infrastructure, software engineering, and
      the contemporary prison abolition movement. As of Fall 2025, they are an
      Assistant Professor of Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College.
