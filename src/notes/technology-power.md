# Technology and Power

The relationship between technology and power is fundamental to understanding social impact and ethical implications of technological systems. Technology never exists in neutral territory - it always embodies and reinforces particular power structures and relationships.

## Power Dynamics in Technology

### Technological Determinism vs Social Construction
The debate between technological determinism and social construction of technology shapes our understanding of how power operates:

- **Determinist View**: Technology autonomously shapes society
- **Social Construction View**: Society shapes technology development
- **Critical View**: Technology and society co-constitute each other within power relations

### Manifestations of Power
- **Access and Control**: Who can use and modify technologies
- **Data and Surveillance**: Information as power
- **Infrastructure**: Control over basic technological systems
- **Knowledge Production**: Who gets to define what counts as expertise

## AI and Power Structures

Artificial intelligence systems present new configurations of power:

### Concentration of Power
- **Corporate Control**: Few companies control major AI systems
- **Computational Resources**: Massive infrastructure requirements
- **Data Dominance**: Access to training data creates advantages
- **Technical Expertise**: Specialized knowledge as gatekeeping

### Algorithmic Power
- **Decision Making**: Automated systems make consequential decisions
- **Classification Systems**: AI determines categories and identities
- **Prediction and Control**: Anticipatory governance and behavior modification
- **Opacity**: Black box systems resist accountability

## Resistance and Alternatives

Following frameworks of "Technologies of Resistance to AI" [@agnewTechnologies]:

### Alternative Approaches
- **Decentralized Systems**: Reducing concentration of power
- **Open Source**: Democratizing access to technology
- **Community Control**: Local ownership and governance
- **Privacy by Design**: Respecting individual autonomy

### Critical Engagement
- **Power Analysis**: Examining who benefits and who is harmed
- **Participatory Design**: Including affected communities
- **Accountability Mechanisms**: Ensuring responsible development
- **Democratic Oversight**: Public control over critical systems

Understanding technology and power requires critical analysis of how systems are designed, who controls them, and what values they embed. This analysis is essential for creating more equitable and just technological futures.
