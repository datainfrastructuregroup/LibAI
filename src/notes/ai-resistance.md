# AI Resistance and Technology Studies

The study of artificial intelligence extends beyond technical implementation to encompass critical examination of power, resistance, and social impact. Technology Studies provides frameworks for understanding how AI systems shape and are shaped by social structures.

## Technologies of Resistance

Resistance to AI is not merely opposition but a critical engagement with technological systems. As Agnew et al. explore in their work on "Technologies of Resistance to AI" [@agnewTechnologies], resistance involves developing alternative frameworks, tools, and practices that challenge dominant AI paradigms.

### Forms of Resistance

- **Critical Frameworks**: Developing analytical tools to interrogate AI systems
- **Alternative Practices**: Creating non-extractive approaches to technology
- **Community Building**: Fostering networks of critical practitioners
- **Policy Advocacy**: Engaging with regulatory and governance structures

## Critical Technology Studies

The field of Technology Studies emphasizes starting "where the pain is" [@2024Start] - focusing on the actual impacts and harms of technological systems rather than abstract potential.

### Methodological Approaches

- **Ethnographic Analysis**: Understanding technology in context
- **Critical Theory**: Applying frameworks of power and domination
- **Participatory Research**: Engaging affected communities
- **Interdisciplinary Dialogue**: Bridging technical and social perspectives

The critical study of AI requires both technical understanding and social analysis, creating spaces for alternative futures and more equitable technological systems.
