description: Isadora Cruxên studies the political economy of development with a focus
      on Latin America and Brazil. Her recent work explores the politics of
      market-making and private investment in water infrastructures and in
      impact investing projects with a socio-environmental focus. This work
      bridges scholarship in development studies, political science, urban
      planning, and geography and engages issues such as financialisation,
      public-private collaboration, regulation, and business politics. Another
      vein of her work examines the politics of knowledge production in relation
      to forms of social struggle and participatory methods of research and
      planning. As a research affiliate at the Data + Feminism Lab at MIT, she
      co-leads the collaborative action-research project called “Data Against
      Feminicide,” which aims to understand data activism about feminicide and
      gender-related violence and work with activists to co-design technological
      tools that support their work. Some of this research has been featured in
      Science. Dr Cruxên holds a PhD in Political Economy, Development and
      Planning (2022) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a
      Master in City Planning (2016) from MIT, and a bachelor’s degree in
      Political Science (2011) from the University of Brasília, Brazil.
